# dbdeployer
[DBdeployer](https://github.com/datacharmer/dbdeployer) is a tool that deploys MySQL database servers easily.
This is a port of [MySQL-Sandbox](https://github.com/datacharmer/mysql-sandbox), originally written in Perl, and re-designed from the ground up in [Go](https://golang.org). See the [features comparison](https://github.com/datacharmer/dbdeployer/blob/master/docs/features.md) for more detail.
